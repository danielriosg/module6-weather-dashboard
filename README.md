<h1>Weather Dashboard</h1>
The Weather Dashboard is a web application that allows users to search for weather information for different cities. The dashboard provides the current weather conditions and a 5-day forecast for the selected city. Users can enter a city name in the search input field and click the "Search" button to retrieve and display the weather data. The application also keeps track of the search history, allowing users to quickly access weather information for previously searched cities.
This dashboard uses the OpenWeatherMap API to fetch weather data. The project uses HTML, CSS, JS and leverages Jquery for the DOM manipulation
